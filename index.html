				Hello, my name is Jordan David and I am First Nations from the Piikani Reserve. Being both First Nations and being raised in the Catholic religion, I have observed the cultural differences from both perspectives and how they can clash when forming an independent identity. During my childhood I was enrolled into the Catholic school system. Even at a young age I never felt like I belong in this religion, and I found myself becoming friends with other First Nations students within the Catholic school system. I gravitated towards these students because I could identify with these First Nations students and found out that they come from a similar cultural background. Looking back, I can see I did not identify myself within the Catholic community, as I was placed in this ideology not by choice. I was not until I became a teenager and started to develop my own identity, I would start to rethink about my place in society, and on my set of beliefs.

					<h2>Three Primary Bases for Identity</h2>
					<p class ="underline"> This research is based of Jan E. Stets and Peter J. Burke's work, "Identity Theory and Social Identity Theory", Philpapers -<a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/ESTITA">https://philpapers.org/rec/ESTITA</a></p>
					
					<p><b>Role Identities:</b> Role identities are about the social roles that we as individuals identify as, such as a mother, or a student. Role identity explains , why we behave the way we do. As a mother you would have the responsibility to be a provider, and as a student you are obligated to maintain academic integrity. </p>	
					
					<p><b>Social Identities:</b> Social identities tend to relate to individuals belonging and identifying with a group. This could anywhere range from nationality, religion, race and gender. Some of these groups we choose to identify with, and some we are born into. For example, you don't ge to pick where you were born, but as an adult you can choose which Country you want to live in. Social identities can influence a individual to join if they feel a shared sense of belonging. </p>
					
					<p><b>Person Identities:</b> Person Identities revolves around a individual rather than a shared group. A personâ€™s identity can be linked to their personality traits, beliefs, values and characteristics. Such as attributes, interests and self-expression. Every identity has their own motive and thus giving the individual a sense of self. </p>
